## About Me

Hello World, I am Albert, and I am currently studying Software Engineering at Unicesumar.

I've always enjoyed developing my own systems and creating solutions that meet my needs.
However, recently, I've made the decision to turn these skills into my professional career, 
bringing with me maturity and a strong sense of responsibility.

I am actively seeking opportunities to practice and
further enhance my technical skills and complex problem-solving abilities.

## Goals

My main objectives at the moment include:

- Improving my programming skills in various languages.
- Exploring and learning about software architecture and design.
- Developing personal projects that challenge and expand my capabilities.
- Deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with the community.
